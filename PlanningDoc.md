# WRoverPlayground Planning Doc

This is the planning document for the WRoverPlayground exercise repo. This document is a work in progress and anyone can contribute. 

In this exercise, students will work on a mock rover navigating through beacons. WRoverPlayground needs to encompass the following topics: 

### Ros setup

TBD

### Ros topics

Subscriber:
Mock navigation data which would be formatting like a lidar, or some coordinate system (would need a lot more math under the hood this way)

Robot heading

Robot coordinate(?)

Publisher: 

Left and right motor powesr

### Ros services

Signaling done by mocking status lights

Waiting for some amount of time before going to next beacon

### Ros debugging/tooling

Using rviz to visualize robot and beacon position

Using rqt_plot to monitor topic data
